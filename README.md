# Design Patterns Repository

Welcome to the **Design Patterns Repository**! This repository contains implementations of essential low-level design patterns in java categorized into three main groups: **Structural**, **Behavioral**, and **Creational**.

## Introduction

Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. This repository provides examples and explanations for a variety of patterns that help you write flexible and maintainable code.

## Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns
- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance.
- **Factory Method**: Creates objects through a common interface.
- **Abstract Factory**: Creates families of related objects.
- **Builder**: Constructs complex objects step by step.
- **Prototype**: Clones existing objects.

### Structural Patterns
- **Adapter**: Converts one interface to another.
- **Bridge**: Separates an abstraction from its implementation.
- **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures.
- **Decorator**: Adds behavior to objects dynamically.
- **Facade**: Simplifies complex subsystems with a unified interface.
- **Flyweight**: Shares objects to minimize memory use.
- **Proxy**: Controls access to another object.

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes a request along a chain of handlers.
- **Command**: Encapsulates requests as objects.
- **Interpreter**: Interprets a language grammar.
- **Iterator**: Traverses elements in a collection.
- **Mediator**: Simplifies communication between objects.
- **Memento**: Captures and restores object state.
- **Observer**: Notifies dependents of state changes.
- **State**: Alters behavior based on an object's state.
- **Strategy**: Defines interchangeable algorithms.
- **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm.
- **Visitor**: Adds operations to object structures.
